This is a guessing game where you get a card which's value is between 0 and 13, then you have to guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the card you currently hold.
if you guess correctly you get 100 points if you guessed wrong you lose 75 points. 
game play is strait forward, just remember to not capitalize anything.
